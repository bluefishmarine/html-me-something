					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>Channel Tunnel</b> (in French “Le tunnel sous la Manche” or “Chunnel”) is a rail tunnel below the English Channel. Its length is 50.5 km and it connects Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom, with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near Calais in northern France. It was finished in 1994. Tunnel is used for traffic of high-speed passenger trains, trains that carry automobiles and other vehicles and cargo trains.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for a tunnel under the English Channel existed as early as 19th century. Albert Mathieu, a French mining engineer, was the first to propose the tunnel in 1802. His plan was for traffic to be done by horse-drawn coaches, illumination would be done with oil lamps and the tunnel would exit the surface in the middle of the Channel where an artificial island would be and where coaches could change horses. The first geological and hydrographical surveys for this tunnel were performed in 1830s by Aimé Thomé de Gamond. He finished in 1856 and presented his results to Napoleon III. Thomé de Gamond then proposed his version of a mined railway tunnel from Cap Gris-Nez to Eastwater Point with an airshaft on the Varne sandbank.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historyofbridges.com/facts-about-bridges/channel-tunnel/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining the Toronto skyline at 553.33m (1,815ft5in), the <b>CN Tower</b> is Canada’s most recognizable and celebrated icon. The CN Tower is an internationally renowned architectural triumph, an engineering Wonder of the Modern World, world-class entertainment and dining destination and a must see for anyone visiting Toronto. Each year, over 1.5 million people visit Canada’s National Tower to take in the breathtaking views and enjoy all the CN Tower has to offer.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After 40 months of construction, the CN Tower was opened to the public on June 26, 1976 and it was well on its way to becoming the country’s most celebrated landmark. It is the centre of telecommunications for Toronto serving over 16 Canadian television and FM radio stations, the workplace of over 500 people throughout the year, and an internationally renowned tourism destination.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/about-us/history/astounding.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies conducted in 1937 by Rijkswaterstaat (Department of Public Works), showed that safety in many parts of the Netherlands could not be guaranteed at times of storms and high sea levels. In the densely populated areas near the river mouths of the Rhine, the Meuse, and the Schelde, it proved very difficult to build new dikes or strengthen the original ones. The first solution was to close all the river mouths: the Western Schelde, the Eastern Schelde, the Haringvliet, and the Brouwershavense Gat. This proposal was christened 'the Deltaplan'. In 1950, the first river mouths of the Brieles' Gat and the Botlek were closed. The Brielse Maas became a freshwater basin. This not only made the area safer, but it also provided Voorne with a freshwater supply. The plan was to build the remaining dams in the following decades. Unfortunately though, the infamous flood of 1953 prevented this from happening. Nearly two thousand people died and more than 150,000 hectares of land were flooded.People soon became aware that something had to be done, and very, very quickly.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty days after the flood of 1953, the Delta commission was inaugurated. The commission would give advice about the execution of the Deltaplan, that would, in the long run, increase the safety of the Delta area. Although safety was the number one priority, the seaways De Nieuwe Waterweg and the Western Schelde would have to stay open, because of the economic importance of the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. In order to be able to build dams in the rivers' mouths, some auxiliary dams would first have to be built in the Zandkreek, the Krammer, the Grevelingen, and the Volkerak. These dams were known as 'compartment dams', since they would divide the large area of water into multiple compartments. In 1959, the Delta Law was passed, in order to organise the construction of the dams. The building of the <b>'Delta Works'</b> was such an enormous project, that it was sometimes referred to as the 'eighth wonder of the world' - and not without good reason.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deltawerken.com/Deltaworks/23.html" target="_blank">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

					<h3>Empire State Building</h3>

					</figure>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Known for its record-breaking height and sophisticated Art Deco style, the <b>Empire State Building</b> is one of New York City’s, if not the world’s, most recognized landmarks. While the building is often used in popular culture as light-natured fodder—such as the opening back drop to your favorite cookie-cutter rom-com or the romantic meeting spot for star-crossed lovers—the building’s past is far more ominous than many of us realize. From failed suicide attempts to accidental plane crashes, its history casts a vibrant lineup of plot-lines and characters spanning the past ninety years.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eiffel Tower, measuring 984 feet, was built in Paris in 1889. And as many French things do, it taunted American architects with its lofty height. The French feat challenged Americans to build something even taller, and its completion marked the beginning of the twentieth century’s great skyscraper race.Prior to the Empire State Building, the U.S. lineup of tall towers included the Metropolitan Life Tower at 700 feet built in 1909, followed by the 729-foot Woolworth Building in 1913, and finally the 927-foot Bank of Manhattan Building in 1929.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.6sqft.com/the-wild-and-dark-history-of-the-empire-state-building/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

					<h3>Golden Gate Bridge</h3>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 5, 1933, construction begins on the <b>Golden Gate Bridge</b>, as workers began excavating 3.25 million cubic feet of dirt for the structure’s huge anchorages.Following the Gold Rush boom that began in 1849, speculators realized the land north of San Francisco Bay would increase in value in direct proportion to its accessibility to the city. Soon, a plan was hatched to build a bridge that would span the Golden Gate, a narrow, 400-foot deep strait that serves as the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, connecting the San Francisco Peninsula with the southern end of Marin County</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the idea went back as far as 1869, the proposal took root in 1916. A former engineering student, James Wilkins, working as a journalist with the San Francisco Bulletin, called for a suspension bridge with a center span of 3,000 feet, nearly twice the length of any in existence. Wilkins’ idea was estimated to cost an astounding $100 million. So, San Francisco’s city engineer, Michael M. O’Shaughnessy (he’s also credited with coming up with the name Golden Gate Bridge), began asking bridge engineers whether they could do it for less.

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam</b> is the largest operational hydroelectric energy producer in the world, with an installed generation capacity of 14GW. The plant is operated by Itaipu Binacional and located on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. Energy generated by Itaipu helps meet demands from the two countries. About 90% of the energy generated by the plant is used by Brazil.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam and the plant are on the Paraná River. Construction of the dam began in February 1971 and cost $19.6bn. The first unit began generating power in May 1984. The second generating unit started operating the same year. As of 2009 Itaipu has 20 generating units, each with a capacity of 700MW.The dam’s reservoir, which covers an area of 1,350km², is the seventh-largest reservoir in Brazil, with a best coefficient of water utilisation of 10.4MW/km².Itaipu generated 94.68 billion kWh of energy in 2008, sufficient to meet worldwide power consumption for two days.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.power-technology.com/projects/itaipu-hydroelectric/" target="_blank">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

					<h3>Panama Canal</h3>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the failure of a French construction team in the 1880s, the United States commenced building a canal across a 50-mile stretch of the Panama isthmus in 1904. The project was helped by the elimination of disease-carrying mosquitoes, while chief engineer John Stevens devised innovative techniques and spurred the crucial redesign from a sea-level to a lock canal. His successor, Lt. Col. George Washington Goethals, stepped up excavation efforts of a stubborn mountain range and oversaw the building of the dams and locks. Opened in 1914, oversight of the world-famous <b>Panama Canal</b> was transferred from the U.S. to Panama in 1999.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of creating a water passage across the isthmus of Panama to link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans dates back to at least the 1500s, when King Charles I of Spain tapped his regional governor to survey a route along the Chagres River. The realization of such a route across the mountainous, jungle terrain was deemed impossible at the time, although the idea remained tantalizing as a potential shortcut from Europe to eastern Asia.&nbsp;
